**Course Description**: Basic stress and strain analysis; pore pressure and in situ stress estimation and measurement; deformation mechanisms in rock; rock fracture description and analysis; wellbore stresses and failure; wellbore stability analysis; fault stability analysis; depletion-induced reservoir deformation; and hydraulic fracturing. Emphasis on applications to petroleum engineering. \


**Prerequisites:** Engineering Mechanics 319 and Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering 301 with a grade of at least C- in each.


**Required Text:**

**Grading Policy:**

 * Midterm Exam 1: 20%

 * Midterm Exam 2: 20%

 * Final Exam: 20%

 * Homeworks, quizzes, lab reports, and computer projects: 40%

 * The following grading rubric will be used to calculate letter grades from the final numerical course grade
   
    | Range | Letter |
    |-----------|--------|
    | > 90      | A      |
    | 89 to < 90.0 | A-  |
    | 86 to < 89 | B+    |
    | 80 to < 86 | B     |
    | 79 to < 80 | B-    |
    | 76 to < 79 | C+    |
    | 70 to < 76 | C     |
    | 69 to < 70 | C-    |
    | 66 to < 69 | D+    |
    | 60 to < 66 | D    |
    | 59 to < 60 | D-    |
    | < 59 | F    |
  
    \

    I reserve the right to curve, but I will only do so in a way that shifts these ranges *down*.  In other words, these letter grades are
    the lowest you could receive if your final numerical grade falls in these ranges, any curve will only work to *improve* your letter grade.


**Outline**

Below is a general outline of what I intend to cover in the course.  This is subject to change based on the needs and preparation of the students in the class.  Any updates will be posted as they occur.
